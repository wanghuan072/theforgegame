      <p><strong>The Forge</strong> is a Roblox RPG that blends resource gathering, intricate crafting mechanics, and combat. While the game features many recipes, weapon types, and dimensions, the core loop is straightforward once you understand the fundamentals. This guide will take you from a novice smith to a master of the forge.</p>

      <h2>1. Getting Started: Races and The Tutorial</h2>
      <p>Upon joining, you will speak to the NPC <strong>Sensei Moro</strong>. He introduces the Race system (referred to as Classes).</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Initial Rolls:</strong> You get three free rolls. While <strong>Golem (1.25%)</strong>, <strong>Angel (0.5%)</strong>, and <strong>Demon (0.5%)</strong> are the best, do not worry if you don't get them immediately. Your starting race does not significantly impact the early tutorial phase.</li>
        <li><strong>The Tutorial:</strong> Follow the on-screen markers. You will learn to navigate menus, mine your first rocks, and forge a basic weapon.</li>
        <li><strong>Forging Tip:</strong> During the forging mini-game, ensure you click exactly when the shrinking ring aligns with the inner circle to achieve a "Perfect" forge.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <img src="/images/guides/guide01-01.webp" alt="The Forge Roblox Beginner Guide: Getting Started" width="50%" style="width: 50%;">

      <h2>2. Combat Fundamentals</h2>
      <p>Combat is introduced early and can be punishing if you just button-mash. Master these mechanics to survive:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Settings:</strong> Enable <strong>Shift Lock</strong> in your Roblox settings (press <strong>Ctrl</strong> to toggle). This allows for much better camera control during fights.</li>
        <li><strong>Movement (Q):</strong> Press <strong>Q</strong> to Dash or Dive. Use this directionally to dodge enemy attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Parrying (F):</strong> Press <strong>F</strong> to block/parry. You must time this perfectly with the enemy's attack animation. <em>Tip: Practice on the starter Zombies. Take a few hits intentionally to learn exactly when the damage registers.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. The "Banana Strategy" (Fast Progression)</h2>
      <p>Once you finish the tutorial and reach <strong>Level 10</strong>, use the portal to travel to the <strong>Second Island (Forgotten Kingdom)</strong>. Do <strong>not</strong> spend your starter money on basic pickaxes yet. Instead, complete this secret objective for a massive head start:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Farm Bananas:</strong> On the first island, mine <strong>Rocks</strong> (not pebbles). They have a chance to drop <strong>Bananite</strong>. Collect 30 of them.</li>
        <li><strong>Locate the Monkey:</strong> On the Second Island, go immediately to the left of the spawn area behind you. Swim to a small, circular island off the coast.</li>
        <li><strong>The Dialogue (Crucial):</strong> Speak to the Monkey NPC. He will ask for food. <br><strong>WARNING:</strong> Select the dialogue option: <em>"Ok, I'll bring you 30 bananite ok?"</em> Do <strong>not</strong> select the 1 or 5 banana options.</li>
        <li><strong>Reward:</strong> Handing over the 30 Bananite will instantly level you up significantly (approx. Level 10 to 15) and reward you with roughly <strong>$10,000</strong>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Use this cash to immediately buy the <strong>Cobalt Pickaxe</strong> from the shop on the Second Island.</p>

      <img src="/images/guides/guide01-02.webp" alt="The Forge Roblox Beginner Guide: Combat Fundamentals" width="50%" style="width: 50%;">

      <h2>4. Forging and Crafting Mechanics</h2>
      <p>Forging is how you create better gear. You can do this at the Forge Stand.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Mix:</strong> You combine ores to create armor or weapons. The Left Side shows your "Forge Chances" (e.g., 60% chance for a Medium Helmet), and the Bottom shows the "Multiplier."</li>
        <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Don't just dump random ores. Balance the ores to maximize the percentage chance of the specific item you want (like a Katana or Chestplate) while maintaining a decent multiplier.</li>
        <li><strong>Experimentation:</strong> Mix different ores like Copper, Iron, and Gems to discover recipes for different rarities.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Upgrading and Enchanting</h2>
      <p>Crafting the item is only the first step. You can make base items significantly stronger.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Enhancer:</strong> Located on the First Island. Use <strong>Essences</strong> (dropped by enemies or found while mining) to increase the base stats of your equipment.</li>
        <li><strong>The Runemaker:</strong> Also on the First Island. You can attach <strong>Runes</strong> (like the <em>Blast Chip</em>) to your weapons. These add special effects, such as explosions or elemental damage, to your attacks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Economy: How to Get Rich</h2>
      <p>If you are struggling for money, do not rely solely on selling ores.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Index:</strong> Open your Backpack and click the <strong>Index</strong> tab. The game rewards you for every new item discovered, ore mined, and enemy killed. Scroll through the Ores, Forge, and Enemies tabs and click everything to claim massive amounts of <strong>XP and Money</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Achievements:</strong> Check the Achievements tab. You can equip "Skills" here that give passive bonuses, such as increased Mining Speed, Luck, or XP gain.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Efficient Mining</h2>
      <p>On the Second Island (Forgotten Kingdom), head to the volcanic cave area. Look for a cluster of rocks near the lava where enemies generally do not patrol. This is an ideal spot to set up an auto-clicker to farm ores safely.</p>
      <p><em>Pro Tip: You can sell items for slightly less than their purchase price. If you upgrade to a new Pickaxe (aim for <strong>Mithril</strong> after Cobalt), sell your old one to recoup costs.</em></p>

      <h2>8. Codes and Rerolls</h2>
      <p>To change your race later in the game, open <strong>Backpack -> Shop -> Race Menu</strong>. Check the settings menu (Gear icon) to enter active codes to get free rerolls. Your late-game goal is to secure a Legendary race like <strong>Demon</strong> or <strong>Angel</strong> for the best stats.</p>

      <p>One of the most confusing quests for new players is the mission to help Tomo the Explorer. Many players struggle with <strong>The Forge Roblox find cat</strong> objective because the creature is hidden behind a locked door and a secret mechanic. If you are frantically searching for <strong>The Forge Roblox lost cat</strong>, you are not alone. This guide will provide a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough to ensure you secure the "Cat Lover" title and the massive gold reward.</p>

      <h2>1. Where to Start: The Forgotten Kingdom</h2>
      <p>To begin your journey to locate <strong>The Forge Roblox cat</strong>, you first need to leave the starter island. You cannot attempt <strong>The Forge Roblox find cat</strong> quest until you meet these specific requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reach Level 10.</li>
        <li>Complete the main story quest "End of the Beginning".</li>
        <li>Unlock the portal to the <strong>Forgotten Kingdom</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once you teleport to the Forgotten Kingdom, the actual search for <strong>The Forge Roblox lost cat</strong> begins near the Goblin Cave area.</p>

      <h2>2. The Barrier: The Goblin King's Demands</h2>

      <img src="/images/guides/guide02-01.webp" alt="The Forge Roblox Cat Guide: The Goblin King's Demands" width="50%" style="width: 50%;">

      <p>The biggest obstacle preventing players from completing <strong>The Forge Roblox find cat</strong> quest is the Goblin King. The cat is locked inside the Goblin Cave, and the King will not open the door until you complete his expensive 5-part quest chain. You cannot reach <strong>The Forge Roblox cat</strong> without paying the following toll:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Quest 1:</strong> Pay 5,000 Gold.</li>
        <li><strong>Quest 2:</strong> Pay 10,000 Gold and 3 Topaz Ore.</li>
        <li><strong>Quest 3:</strong> Pay 15,000 Money and 5 Diamonds.</li>
        <li><strong>Quest 4:</strong> Pay 20,000 Money and 5 Emeralds.</li>
        <li><strong>Quest 5:</strong> Pay 25,000 Money and 5 Rubies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Only after investing over 75,000 gold and precious gems will the door open, allowing you to proceed with <strong>The Forge Roblox lost cat</strong> mission.</p>

      <h2>3. The Secret Mechanic: Why You Must Be a Dwarf</h2>
      <p>This is the most critical part of the guide. Even after opening the door, many players still fail <strong>The Forge Roblox find cat</strong> objective because they cannot physically reach the pet. <strong>The Forge Roblox cat</strong> is hiding inside a tiny hole behind a waterfall.</p>
      <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> You must change your race to <strong>Dwarf</strong>. The hole is too small for Humans, Orcs, or Elves. If you want to retrieve <strong>The Forge Roblox lost cat</strong>, go to your race menu and reroll or select Dwarf. Being small is the only way to fit through the gap in the wall.</p>

      <h2>4. Exact Location: Behind the Waterfall</h2>

      <img src="/images/guides/guide02-02.webp" alt="The Forge Roblox Cat Guide: Exact Location: Behind the Waterfall" width="50%" style="width: 50%;">

      <p>Once you are a Dwarf and the cave is open, here is exactly how to execute <strong>The Forge Roblox find cat</strong> finale:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Enter the newly unlocked Goblin Cave.</li>
        <li>Walk past the Goblin King and head straight toward the back.</li>
        <li>Locate the large waterfall flowing into a pool.</li>
        <li>Walk directly <em>through</em> the water. Hidden behind the curtain of water is a tiny tunnel.</li>
        <li>Walk through the tunnel (requires Dwarf size). Inside, you will finally see <strong>The Forge Roblox cat</strong> (a small black cat named "TomoCat").</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>5. Rewards: Is It Worth It?</h2>
      <p>After you interact with the pet and get the notification "You got a new item! [Tomo's Cat]," return to Tomo outside. Completing <strong>The Forge Roblox lost cat</strong> quest grants substantial rewards that make the expensive Goblin King payments worth it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>~25,000 Money:</strong> A nice refund on your investment.</li>
        <li><strong>Massive XP:</strong> Enough to level you up multiple times if you are mid-game.</li>
        <li><strong>"Cat Lover" Title:</strong> An exclusive title to show you finished the quest.</li>
        <li><strong>The Pet:</strong> You get to keep <strong>The Forge Roblox cat</strong> in your inventory as a collectable item.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By following these steps, you will solve the mystery of <strong>The Forge Roblox find cat</strong> and add a unique item to your collection.</p>

      <p><strong>The Forge</strong> is a game defined by its grind. Whether it is timing the perfect hammer strike or searching for rare Uranium rocks, the process can take hours. This is why many players search for <strong>the forge script roblox</strong> to automate the tedious parts of the game. In this guide, we will explore what these scripts can actually do, the best features to look for, and how to stay safe while using them.</p>

      <h2>1. What Can "The Forge Script Roblox" Do?</h2>
      <p>When you execute a high-quality <strong>the forge script roblox</strong>, you are essentially bypassing the manual input required for the game's core mechanics. Here are the most popular features found in modern scripts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Auto Forge (100% Success):</strong> The most sought-after feature. Forging requires perfect timing on a shrinking circle. A script detects the UI element and clicks automatically, guaranteeing a "Masterwork" or "Perfect" craft every single time.</li>
        <li><strong>Auto Mine / Ore Farm:</strong> Instead of running around the map, scripts can teleport your character directly to specific ores (e.g., "Teleport to Topaz" or "Farm Bananite").</li>
        <li><strong>Kill Aura / Auto Combat:</strong> This feature automatically attacks enemies within a certain range and, more importantly, can <strong>Auto Parry</strong> attacks, making you invincible in dungeons like the Goblin Cave.</li>
        <li><strong>ESP (Extra Sensory Perception):</strong> This draws boxes or text overlays around valuable items, showing you exactly where rare ores or quest items (like Tomo's Cat) are located through walls.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/guides/guide03-01.webp" alt="The Forge Roblox Script Guide: What Can 'The Forge Script Roblox' Do?" width="50%" style="width: 50%;">

      <h2>2. How to Use Scripts in The Forge</h2>
      <p>If you are new to Roblox exploiting, using <strong>the forge script roblox</strong> requires a specific tool called an "Executor." Here is the general process:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Download an Executor:</strong> You need software that can inject Lua code into Roblox. Popular options change frequently due to Roblox's anti-cheat updates (Byfron), but names like Solara, Wave, or Hydrogen (for Mobile/Android) are common.</li>
        <li><strong>Find the Script:</strong> Search for "The Forge Roblox Pastebin" or check repositories like ScriptBlox. Look for scripts that have been updated recently to ensure they work with the latest game version.</li>
        <li><strong>Injection:</strong> Open Roblox, launch The Forge, and "Inject" your executor.</li>
        <li><strong>Execution:</strong> Paste the <strong>the forge script roblox</strong> code into the executor and hit "Execute." A GUI (Graphical User Interface) should appear on your screen.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>3. The "Infinite Money" Method with Scripts</h2>
      <p>While there is no direct "Give Money" button due to server-side checks, <strong>the forge script roblox</strong> can simulate infinite money through efficiency. By enabling <strong>Auto Mine</strong> on high-value ores (like Mithril or Uranium) and using <strong>Auto Sell</strong>, you can generate cash 10x faster than a normal player. Combined with <strong>Auto Forge</strong>, you can mass-produce high-rarity weapons and sell them for a massive profit without lifting a finger.</p>

      <h2>4. Risks and Safety Warnings</h2>
      <p>Before you download any <strong>the forge script roblox</strong>, you must understand the risks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ban Risk:</strong> Roblox takes cheating seriously. While The Forge might not have the most advanced anti-cheat, Roblox's platform-wide detection can catch you. Always use an alternate account (alt account) to test scripts first.</li>
        <li><strong>Malware:</strong> "Executors" and "Scripts" are common vectors for viruses. Never download an .exe file that claims to be a script (scripts are text/lua files). Only download executors from their official, verified websites.</li>
        <li><strong>Game Updates:</strong> If The Forge updates, your script might break or become detected. Always check the date of the script before using it.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Using <strong>the forge script roblox</strong> can completely change your gameplay experience, turning a slow RPG into an idle tycoon game. Whether you just want the "Auto Forge" feature to save your mouse or full "Auto Farming" to top the leaderboards, always prioritize your account security. Use scripts responsibly, and happy forging!</p>

      <p>In <strong>The Forge</strong>, your race determines your playstyle, offering unique stat bonuses and passive abilities. Many players start with common races like Human or Zombie but eventually want to upgrade to legendary tiers like Angel or Demon. If you are wondering <strong>how to change race in the forge roblox</strong>, there are three main methods: using the in-game shop, redeeming limited-time codes, and using the social gifting system.</p>

      <h2>1. The Standard Method: Accessing the Race Menu</h2>
      <p>The primary way to change your race is through the game's menu system. It is slightly hidden for new players, so follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open your <strong>Backpack</strong>.</li>
        <li>Click on the <strong>Shop</strong> tab.</li>
        <li>Scroll all the way to the <strong>Right</strong> until you see the "Race Chances" list.</li>
        <li>Click the button that says <strong>"Go to Race Menu"</strong>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>From here, you can spend your available "Spins" to reroll. Be careful—once you click reroll, your current race is gone forever unless you spin it again!</p>

      <img src="/images/guides/guide04-01.webp" alt="How to Change Race in The Forge Roblox: The Standard Method: Accessing the Race Menu" width="50%" style="width: 50%;">

      <h2>2. How to Get Free Rerolls: Codes</h2>
      <p>The developers frequently release codes that grant between 5 to 10 free rerolls. This is the most efficient method for players asking <strong>how to change race in the forge roblox</strong> without spending Robux.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Current Code Strategy:</strong> Look for codes like <code>peak!</code> (case sensitive). These often drop during weekends or updates.</li>
        <li><strong>Where to find them:</strong> Codes expire very quickly. It is highly recommended to join the official game Discord or check the game's Roblox page daily.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. The Gifting System: A Unique Mechanic</h2>
      <p>Unlike many other Roblox RPGs, <strong>The Forge</strong> allows players to buy items for others. If you are out of Robux or spins, a friend can actually fund your race change.</p>
      <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open the Shop.</li>
        <li>On the right side, you will see a list of players in your server under "Select the receiver".</li>
        <li>Select your friend's name.</li>
        <li>Buy a "Reroll Pack" (e.g., 10 Rerolls).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The spins will instantly appear in their inventory. This is a great way for high-level players to help beginners get a better starting class.</p>

      <img src="/images/guides/guide04-02.webp" alt="How to Change Race in The Forge Roblox: The Gifting System: A Unique Mechanic" width="50%" style="width: 50%;">

      <h2>4. Why Change? The Power of the Demon Race</h2>
      <p>Is rerolling worth it? Absolutely. If you manage to roll the **0.5% Demon Race**, you gain massive advantages that outclass standard races like Orc or Elf. Here are the stats for the Demon race:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Demonic Power:</strong> +20% Movement Speed, +20% Attack Speed, +20% Physical Damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Fire Mastery:</strong> +20% Stronger Fire Damage (perfect for late-game weapons).</li>
        <li><strong>Backfire:</strong> 25% chance to burn enemies when you take damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Devil's Finger:</strong> A special dash that teleports you with hellfire particles, dealing area-of-effect (AOE) damage to nearby enemies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Understanding <strong>how to change race in the forge roblox</strong> is essential for reaching these high-tier power levels. Don't settle for being a Human—start spinning for that 0.5% chance today!</p>

      <p>In <strong>The Forge</strong>, spam-clicking your weapon will only get you so far. As you progress to the volcanic caves and fight Elite mobs, you will die quickly if you don't master defense. The most important skill to learn is <strong>how to parry in the forge roblox</strong>. Unlike a standard block that only reduces damage, a "Perfect Parry" completely negates damage and often stuns the enemy, opening them up for a critical counter-attack.</p>

      <h2>1. The Basics: How to Execute a Parry</h2>
      <p>The controls are simple, but the execution is hard. On PC, the default key is <strong>F</strong>. On mobile, it is the shield icon.</p>
      <p>To perform a Perfect Parry, you must press the block button <strong>at the exact moment</strong> the enemy's attack is about to hit you. If you hold the button too early, you will just "Block" (taking chip damage). If you press it too late, you take full damage.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Visual Cue:</strong> When successful, you will see a bright spark or flash at the point of impact, and a "DING" sound effect will play.</li>
        <li><strong>Status:</strong> Your health bar will show 0 damage taken.</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="/images/guides/guide05-01.webp" alt="How to Parry in The Forge Roblox: The Basics: How to Execute a Parry" width="50%" style="width: 50%;">

      <h2>2. Timing Guide for Specific Enemies</h2>
      <p>Different enemies have different attack speeds. Here is a breakdown of <strong>how to parry in the forge roblox</strong> against the most common threats shown in high-level gameplay:</p>

      <h3>Elite Deathaxe Skeleton</h3>
      <p>These enemies hit hard but are slow. They raise their axe high above their head.</p>
      <p><strong>Timing:</strong> Do not panic when they raise the axe. Wait until the axe reaches the peak of the swing and <em>starts</em> its downward motion. Press F as the axe handle passes their head level.</p>

      <h3>Blazing Slime</h3>
      <p>Slimes are tricky because they don't have arms. They attack by lunging or jumping at you.</p>
      <p><strong>Timing:</strong> Watch the slime's body compress. As soon as it launches into the air toward you, wait for it to reach the apex of its jump. Press F right as it begins to descend onto your character model.</p>

      <h3>Elite Rogue Skeleton</h3>
      <p>These are fast dual-wielders. They have a very short wind-up animation.</p>
      <p><strong>Timing:</strong> You need to play reactively. As soon as you see their shoulder twitch or their dagger move back, press F immediately. You cannot wait for the swing like you do with the Deathaxe; you must predict the hit.</p>

      <h3>The Reaper</h3>
      <p>This boss-tier enemy uses a massive Scythe with a wide sweep.</p>
      <p><strong>Timing:</strong> The Reaper pulls the scythe far back behind him. This is a "delayed attack." Many players parry too early. Hold your ground, wait for the forward swing to actually begin, and parry right before the blade connects with your torso.</p>

      <h2>3. Pro Tips for Consistent Parrying</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ping Matters:</strong> Roblox servers can have latency. If you have high ping, you need to press F slightly <em>earlier</em> than the visual animation suggests.</li>
        <li><strong>Sound Cues:</strong> Turn your volume up. Many enemies make a grunt or a "whoosh" sound right before the damage frame. Learning the audio cues is often easier than watching the animations.</li>
        <li><strong>Practice Dummy:</strong> Go back to the starter island and practice on the weak Zombies. They deal low damage, allowing you to learn the rhythm of <strong>how to parry in the forge roblox</strong> without risking death.</li>
      </ul>
